We had hoped to have an in-person St. Lawrence Regional Gathering this fall at the end of September, but the location we had planned to use is no longer available. The Monthly Meeting responsible for the next program did not feel that an alternate fall venue could be found. COVID-19 is also still giving us uncertainties around in-person gatherings. May we see an improvement in that over the winter and may we ruminate on possible in-person gathering spots for early June.

Perhaps we can have an on-line meeting with Zoom in early April to discuss a Spring gathering (probably in early June?).
