The St. Lawrence Regional Gathering will take place in Gananoque, Ontario, from August 29 to August 31, 2025. The gathering is for Friends attending Meetings between Peterborough, ON, and Montreal, QC (including Quebec City), but is open to all who can attend. 

Once you register, you will be informed how to get to the site. The gathering is free and please note that they ask Friends to bring a meal which can be shared potluck style. They regret that they cannot provide food or coordinate the potluck this time, so ask Friends with dietary restrictions to expect that the potluck meals will not be to their needs. Trips to the grocery store can occur throughout the gathering for those without a car.

Please [contact us](/contact) with any concerns or questions. We can also share information about rideshares.

Note that the gathering organizing committee is asking the Meetings to each contribute 75$ to cover breakfasts and snacks. The lunch and dinner meals are being handled as potluck contributions from participants.
