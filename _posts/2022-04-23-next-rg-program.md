title: "2022 Gathering, May 27-28 on Zoom"
description: "Theme: Relevance of the Peace Testimony to Political Protest"
---
The topic for Regional Gathering's meeting is "Relevance of the Peace Testimony to Political Protest." On Friday we will view two QuakerSpeak videos, followed by peace songs. On Saturday an individual from each Meeting will share their personal story about involvement in political protest or civil disobedience. Queries and general discussion in breakout rooms will follow each presentation.

There will be an invitation to children/youth as well to participate, as they can, through a query specific to them.

## Proposed schedule
### Friday, May 27

7-8:30 pm – Intergenerational: welcome and brief go-round

Children and youth, two queries for tomorrow:

* What can you tell us about Fridays for Future?
* Have you taken part in a protest? Why did you do that? Or why did you not do that?

Children and youth welcome to join in at any time, but please come back at 2 pm tomorrow to bring us what you have found about these two questions.

View two QuakerSpeak videos, followed by peace songs and worship sharing.

10-10:30 am – Welcome and opening worship

10:30-11:15: Story from Peterborough Monthly Meeting; First Query: What issues, conditions, or problems do you know about where you have seen the use of protests? Did you find that the protest was effective? Moral? In what ways? Break away groups; responses

World Beyond War: “AGSS is World BEYOND War’s blueprint for an alternative security system – one in which peace is pursued by peaceful means.

AGSS relies on three broad strategies for humanity to end war: 1) demilitarizing security, 2) managing conflicts without violence, and 3) creating a culture of peace. These are the interrelated components of our system: the frameworks, processes, tools and institutions necessary for dismantling the war machine and replacing it with a peace system that will provide a more assured common security. Strategies for demilitarizing security are directed at reducing dependency on militarism. Strategies for managing conflict without violence are focused on reforming and/or establishing new institutions, tools and processes for assuring security. Strategies for creating a culture of peace are concerned with establishing social and cultural norms, values, and principles necessary for sustaining a thriving peace system and the means to spread it globally.”
