Once or twice a year, the Quaker meetings and worship groups along the St. Lawrence river gather. This June gathering of Ottawa, Montreal, Peterborough, Wooler, Thousand Islands, and their nearby worship groups, is known as regional gathering. Organization is rotated and information is available through our [contact page](/contact.html) or through [Montreal Monthly Meeting](https://montreal.quaker.ca).
