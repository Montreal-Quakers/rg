Some people, for various reasons, attend meeting and even serve on Quaker committees for many years without being a member. Anyone, member or attender, is welcome at meeting and can help us make decisions. That said, membership also is important, even if there are few specific distinctions or privileges that come with it.
* We are all shaped by experiences. At some point, becoming a member is simply an honest statementthat we have been shaped by this Quaker community
* Membership should be a leading from Spirit, in other words, an expression of the miracle of love for this community
  * The purpose of the membership process is to discern whether this miracle has happened, and if so, celebrate

Interested in becoming a member of Montreal Quaker Meeting? Here is the process:

1. Write a letter to the Clerk stating that you wish to apply for membership. Include a little about yourself, such as:
  * How long have you been attending?
  * How involved are you?
  * What makes you want to be a member?
  * What has your faith journey been like?
2. Give that letter to the clerk by hand, mail or email.
3. Someone from the Ministry & Counsel committee will contact you to ask who youâ€™d like to have on your clearness committee
4. The Clerk will read your letter and form a committee at the next business meeting
5. At the clearness committee meeting, the others will ask you questions about your faith journey, your relationship with wider Quakerism, and how you see your relationship as a member going forward.
6. The clearness committee will craft a recommendation, which will be presented at the following business meeting.
7. The community will accept or reject the recommendation of the clearness committee.

The most important thing then is to have a party to celebrate the miracle of community.
