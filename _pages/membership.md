Interested in becoming a member of Montreal Quaker Meeting? Here’s how it works:

1. Write a letter to the Clerk stating that you wish to apply for membership. Include a little about yourself, such as:
  * How long have you been attending?
  * How involved are you?
  * What makes you want to be a member?
  * What has your faith journey been like?
2. Give that letter to the clerk by hand, mail or email.
3. Someone from the Ministry & Counsel committee will contact you to ask who you’d like to have on your clearness committee
4. The Clerk will read your letter and form a committee at the next business meeting
5. At the clearness committee meeting, the others will ask you questions about your faith journey, your relationship with wider Quakerism, and how you see your relationship as a member going forward.
6. The clearness committee will craft a recommendation, which will be presented at the following business meeting.
7. The community will accept or reject the recommendation of the clearness committee.
