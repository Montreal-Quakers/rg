Peterborough planning committee met last week and came up with a preliminary plan for a virtual Regional Gathering this year. We propose holding the gathering over Zoom on June 6 with a morning and afternoon session (including a meeting for worship for business).

* In the morning session, we invite Friends to share personal stories from quarantine. 
* After the stories we will have music until the break.
* In the afternoon session we will have an Art Sharing session. Friends will be encouraged to bring a poem, drawing, song, film, joke etc. that has spiritually nourished them within the last couple of months. We will share our piece with the group and have some time for discussion.
* And from 3-4 pm we will have the business meeting.

We'll also be having break-out sessions at certain moments. Could be for one on one catch-ups, conflict resolution/healing (with M&C volunteers?), small group discussions, organizing etc. 

The music would be up to how the musician would like to organize it: over Zoom, streamed on YouTube or Facebook etc. 

The meeting for worship for business would include everyone in one Zoom session. At the start and close of the afternoon and morning sessions we can all meet in one group as well.

A registration form is available [here](https://forms.gle/v7ntj4iipz3BNfDf9){: target="_blank"}. If someone were available to help me keep track of responses to the form and plan out the Zoom hosts and participants, that would be very helpful, please email us.
