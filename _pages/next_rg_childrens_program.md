There will be an invitation to children/youth as well to participate, as they can, through a query specific to them.

Children and youth, two queries for Saturday:

* What can you tell us about Fridays for Future?
* Have you taken part in a protest? Why did you do that? Or why did you not do that?

Children and youth welcome to join in at any time, but please come back at 2 pm Saturday to bring us what you have found about these two questions.
