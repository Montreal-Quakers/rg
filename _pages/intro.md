<i class="fab fa-fly fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text"></i> Meaningful life. Quakers seek clarity of purpose.
  * <i class="fab fa-gratipay fa-fw color-1-dark-text"></i> We aim to be in touch with what is truthful, important, and joyous. 
  * <i class="fas fa-pied-piper-hat fa-fw color-1-dark-text"></i> Each individual will be called to live differently. 
  * <i class="fas fa-icons fa-fw color-1-dark-text"></i> Our community exists to give us the strength to live boldly.

<i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h fa-fw fa-2x color-1-text"></i> An accepting community. Quakers are egalitarian.
  * <i class="fas fa-cubes fa-fw color-1-light-text"></i> We celebrate the leadership within our community, but minimize special roles. 
  * <i class="fas fa-chess-bishop fa-fw color-1-light-text"></i> Everyone can be a "minister"; we have no paid positions, no priests, no hierarchy.
  * <i class="fas fa-building fa-fw color-1-light-text"></i> Quakers in Canada and elsewhere do not make decisions for Montreal Quakers.

<i class="fas fa-road fa-fw fa-2x color-1-dark-text"></i> Open-ended quest. We can't tell anyone [what to believe](/testimonies.html). 
  * <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw color-1-text"></i> Many among us cherish holy texts, particularly the Bible, but many don't.
     * We have no communal holy book, even if we celebrate Quaker authors.
  * <i class="fas fa-globe-americas fa-fw color-1-text"></i> We seek loving, meaningful lives as best we can, using any means that speak to us.
